									<p>Easy access, cheap, single-board, microcontrollers with open-source software and hardware that is easy to learn, understand and use with limitless potential and countless community guides and user-community and company interactivity. Something like this sounds like it could very easily revolutionise and change the way we teach, learn about, and use microcontrollers for anything from a simple LED circuit, to a fully operational animatronic. It also sounds like something out of reach and could be very difficult to get off the ground. But what if I told you about an easy-to-use hardware and software that has become common knowledge and first thought towards thousands, if not millions, of mechatronic or system engineering projects?
									<p>Originally created at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute, Arduino is, at its core, an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. It is completely open-source electronics platform that has everything you need in a single board. With the assistance of a free-to-use Arduino Software, you can make the Arduino board read any input and produce any output you could imagine. Arduino has become so popular due to its simplistic hardware and software, making it easy for beginners to learn, and its flexibility, allowing professionals to create complex projects based around the single microcontroller. Arduino is not the only one of its kind, however.
									<p>A series of small single-board computer developed in the United Kingdom have also become widely popular and a standard name alongside Arduino. In association with Broadcom, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the Raspberry Pi project back in 2012, aiming for the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and developing countries. The creation of the Raspberry Pi, a low cost, credit-card sized computer that can do anything and everything you would expect a desktop computer to do. Just by plugging it into a monitor with a mouse and keyboard, and a little bit Scratch and Python programming knowledge, you can use it to browse the internet, play a high-definition video, make a spreadsheet, or even play video games. It even can interact with the outside world and is used in all sorts of projects from children in schools, to people in third world countries, to professionals undertaking major projects that most would not even be able to believe.
									<p>Cheap, small, resourceful microcontrollers like these can be found in just about any appliance these days. With the right knowhow, you could even strip a cheap little remote-control car or drone and give it a whole new purpose. You can add more features, like LED lights, or use it to help a thirsty village. All that knowhow and tinkering must come from somewhere though, and Arduino and Raspberry Pi are the perfect foundations to build a profession in the mechatronic world we live in today. And with the trend of the past, present and future, and with technology getting smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, we could very well have all the capabilities of a super-computer inside a small board like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
									<p>This technology has already had a major impact on the world, especially in our schools. 10 years ago, the world would have only dreamt about being able to teach young children about computers, electronics, and programming. But the way the world is run now, it is becoming a necessity. Technology like this being able to be taught in schools so easily and cheaply, allows for children at any school to be able to play and learn about animatronics and be able to find a passion in a related area. A passion that could spark newfound knowledge in years to come and allow us to evolve the world even more. We have in fact, only just started the digital era and there are no signs of it slowing down any time soon.
