									<p>Darren's key role as Account General Manager is to look after key customer accounts, which often is dealing with clients from within the Government sector. When a contract for a project is issued, Darren's role would include liaising with the product owner, who would be from the business which issued the contract and who would be responsible for the project itself. The product owner would outline the goals and requirements of the project and Darren would facilitate the forming of project team personnel and outside partners to deliver the project. The product owner would be the single point of contact for the course of the project.
									<p>In the process of delivering the project, Darren would interact with the product owner and other personnel from the client business. One example would be building a new system for the Job Seeker program for the Department of Education, Skills and Training. Through the course of a project, Darren would also interact with members of the teams under his control and personnel from partner organisations, that may have been brought into aid. Working with the product owner, Darren and the assigned team would be the infrastructure to fit the specifications outlined by the product owner. At the same time, working with the product owner and other stake holders, Darren would help the department develop their business model to not just be able to use the new system, but to take advantage of it. Such as the use of data analytics to help drive meaningful change, not only within the department but the communities themselves, in how the services are delivered.
									<p>Darren divides his time between running his part of the business within DXC and managing personnel assigned to teams that have tasked to projects under his supervision. He would also have to devote time to meeting stakeholders up-coming projects or projects that are underway. Majority of projects now are to aid businesses migrate from in-house infrastructure to the cloud. These do range from mainframe to server-based systems.
									<p>One of the fundamental issues faced by Darren on a regular basis in his role, is resistance to change coming from personnel from the within the client organisation. Sometimes the resistance is down to genuine security concerns, with extremely sensitive and highly valued data being floated around to be placed in the cloud. One example is that the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission) still maintains the Australian electoral roll on a mainframe computer. This is securely located within the AEC's own network itself. AEC are having discussions to update the electoral system and migrate to the cloud with security of up most importance. DXC is confident that by using Microsoft Azure, which is highly secure itself, and DXC's additional security layering, that they would be able to keep the Australian electoral roll safe. Another source of resistance is brought about by the fear of the changes implemented could leave the skills of certain personnel redundant, and therefore no longer required. Resistance to change, however benign and regardless of source, must be delt cautiously and diplomatically.
