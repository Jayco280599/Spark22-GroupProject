										<p>My name is Kevin Sweeney, and my student ID is s3894218. I am a member of the team Spark 22. I was born and raised in the Kimberley region of Western Australia where I have lived and worked for various periods of my life. I currently work full-time as store manager of the local hardware store. I have always had a love for technology and have a penchant for science fiction movies and television shows. I gained an interest in IT (Information Technology) ever since I first saw a personal computer and developed during high school. My knowledge of computing expanded with my time working as a system administrator at Kwinana Senior High School (now Gilmore College) and I am avid user of open-source software such as FreeBSD, Firefox, Thunderbird, and LibreOffice. Living in the Kimberley, I do occasionally go four-wheel-driving and camping when time and weather allow. Fishing is big in the top-end, but I am not really into it.

										<p>According to the 16 Personalities and The Big Five personality test, I could be described as analytical, imaginative, original, open-minded, enthusiastic, objective honest and straightforward. The personality tests also suggested that I am introverted, confidant, artistic and an intellectual thinker. The 16 Personalities test put me as a turbulent logician and The Big Five test results did agree with this assessment. The Personal Learning Profile was narrower in scope for a personality assessment but did fit within the results of the other two assessments.

									<li>
									<li>Kevin Sweeney's ideal job is Network Engineer as advertised by Freelancer.com. The position would have meant he would have been a member of the team responsible for the operation of the networks used be Freelancer.com. It would have required deep understanding of network topologies and technologies, network hardware, open-sourced software and various network monitoring tools used by Freelancer.com. It would be a challenging role from a technical point of view with the benefits from working in a team environment.

									<p><b>Applicable Occupations:</b> Network/Systems Administrator (4), Network Support Officer (12), Network Engineer/Architect (15)
									<br>The top 3 occupations that have not been included in this list are:
									<li>Software Developer / Engineer (1)
									<li>Computer Systems Engineer / Architect (2)
									<li>Systems Analyst (3)
									<p>
									<p>My preferred occupation of Network Engineer technically came in at 15th on the list behind UI/UX Designer. The roles of Software Developer/Engineer and Computer System Engineer/Architect reflects the demand of business for skills to help them move into the cloud computing space and this trend is likely to continue for near future. Systems Analyst would have the skills required to ensure that business infrastructure and policies are working as they should as the business moves to the cloud. Network Engineers role itself has remained largely unchanged in the past two decades but has evolved to meet the changes in technology and the industry move towards cloud computing.
									<p><b>Applicable Job Titles:</b> Network Engineer (9), Senior Network Engineer (21)
									<br>The top 3 job titles that have not been included in this list are:
									<li>Solutions Architect (1)
									<li>Graphic Designer (2)
									<li>.NET Developer (3)
									<p>
									<p>The number one job title of Solutions Architect is another clear indicator of businesses desire to get into the cloud as soon as possible. The job titles Graphic Designer and .NET Developer also reinforces the business trend of moving into the cloud as applications will need to be redeveloped to work with cloud and new applications to developed to replace existing software. With Front End Developer and JAVA Developer coming in at sixth and seventh, confirms this notion. Network Engineering coming in at ninth on the list means maintaining reliability and performance of networks is still important to businesses in the information age.
									<p><b>Applicable IT Skills:</b> Technical Support (11), LINUX (13), Customer Service (14) and Systems Engineering (24)
									<br>The top 3 IT skills that have not been included in this list are:
									<li>SQL (1)
									<li>JavaScript (2)
									<li>Java (3)
									<p>
									<p>The top three skills of 2018 according to Burning Glass being SQL, JavaScript, and JAVA, highlights the current business trend of moving into cloud and continuing with building an on-line business presence on the Internet. The Project Management skill coming in at 5th does confirm that these cloud migration projects are either starting or at least in the planning phase.
									<p><b>Generic Skills:</b> Communication Skills (1), Problem Solving (2), Organisational Skills (3), Writing (4), Teamwork/Collaboration (5), Troubleshooting (6), Planning (7), Quality Assurance and Control (14)
									<br>The top 3 generic skills that have not been included in this list are:
									<li>Detail-Oriented (8)
									<li>Creativity (9)
									<li>Research (10)
									<p>
									<p>Though I could have included these skills at a stretch, these skills are not always necessary nor sort after by employers for the role of Network Engineer. Being Detail-Orientated would consider to be a good skill to have, especially when it comes to documenting infrastructure and processes. Creativity, I believe, is not crucial skill but could be a handy skill in troubleshooting scenarios. Research skill is more something you would need in a consulting or architect role, but not necessary in Network Engineering role on a day-to-day basis. Communication Skills are always important when working in teams and communicating with people outside your team within the organisation. Problem Solving is always required when faced with technical issues and Organisational Skills to deal with them when they do arise.
									<p>My opinion of the role of Network Engineer remains unchanged, as I believe it still a role of importance even with the move to cloud computing. I would still enjoy the technical challenges that would come with the role and the career opportunities that the role can provide. Once becoming a Network Engineer, I can make training and educational choices to enable me to move into Network Consultant or Network Architect roles.
