									<p>The project idea is a long distance, self-training, automated ball thrower for dogs. An automated device in which a dog, or person, puts a rubber ball into a feeder. The system would then output a biscuit, or some other form of treat, the action of rewarding the dog is an incentive for the dog to keep playing that game. It would then feed the ball into the motorized chamber; it would then be launched at an adjustable setting such as speed and trajectory for different environments. Everyone has that overly energetic dog that just wants to keep playing when you are just too tired or busy to throw the ball. These highly active dogs have a never-ending supply of energy and never understands the word "no" when it comes to playtime. With this device, whether you have a large yard, a small one or go to the park or beach, it is the perfect companion for both you and your dog wherever that may be. This device will be compact with a rechargeable power supply for easy portability. It's ability to be adjusted will come from 2 dials: on the unit 1 for the Y-elevation and the other for the speed. The dial system is designed to be as easy as possible and require minimal effort, experience, and knowledge to use to its full ability. The launching mechanism with be a simple spinning wheel system, to save power, will only run when the ball is loaded and ready to be fired. Once the wheel is up to speed, the ball will be fed into it, launching it out of the chamber and the wheel will wind down until it is returned. Although the wheel will be easily adjustable and create its own unpredictability for the ball launch, so the dog cannot just sit and catch it, it also requires more power and can result in motor ware over time. The system will also have a self-training mode where, with a flick of a switch, it will drop a treat into a bowl for the dog to enjoy whenever the ball is put into the feeder. The feeder will be as low to the ground as possible to account for all types of dogs and will have an ultrasound sensor inside it to detect whether the ball is rolled in or not. I have chosen this sensor over others so that the dog does not find a way to trick the system into just outputting treats and requires something, the ball, to be fed in. Once the ball is recognised to have been put in the feeder, a conveyer will turn on, moving the ball from the feeder and feeding it into the wheel once it has gotten up to speed. Having the conveyer only move when the ball is put in for the moment of moving it from feeder to launching chamber will save power and allow use of a stepper motor for precise movements. This automated system will have enough battery life to last at least 30 mins when fully charged, and hopefully, if the extra battery weight is not too much, could be looked to be extended to 45 minutes or even over an hour. This will require testing for the power usage of the entire system, how many battery cells will be needed to last that long and how much it will all weight. The outer housing will be cheap, lightweight but durable plastic to protect the mechanics and electronics it is housing from external damage, like weather or user. To recharge, all that is required is to plug a cable into a standard household power outlet and whilst plugged in, will be able to last continuously. The treats system will use a simple rotating disk with a hole and stepper motor to dispense a small amount of dry dog food as a treat for returning the ball. Components required for this project are quite basic and the system could be easily mass-produced.</p>

									<p>A commercially available Arduino or similar SBC would be used as the smart controller of the system. This would make prototyping the controller side of the product cheaper and simpler, as they are readily available with widely supported toolchain. Initial prototype would be built using off-the-shelf general hardware components where possible, thus reducing initial cost and complexity. This allow a proof-of-concept design to be built and tested. Once the proof of concept, the use of 3D Printing technologies can also be used to prototype more complex design elements, as the prototype evolves closer to the final form ready for production. A small batch of test prototypes have been made for product testing with potential end users of the product. The product testing would be used to ensure the product design is sound and the see how the product fits with the intended use case and target market. Once initial product testing has completed, the results will need to be analysed to see if any design changes need to be made. Feedback from the testing would be instrumental in how the final product design evolves. Additions and alterations of product features will need to be accessed during the prototyping phases. Once the feature list and fundamental design is locked down, production prototypes can be made and tested.</p>
									<p>If we able to make this project successful, it would mean an easy-to-use system for overly energetic dogs to amuse themselves and exercise with as their owners relax. With a system like this, if it can be made to the correct price point and match with a feature set that pet owners will find appealing, there is no reason such a product like this cannot be succeed in the marketplace.</p>
