									<p>Everyone has that overly energetic dog that just wants to keep playing when you are just too tired throw the ball. Well at least I do. My Kelpie seems to have an infinite power supply and never understands the word no when it comes to playtime. With this device, whether you have a large yard, a small one or go to the park or beach, it is a perfect companion for your pooch wherever they are.</p>
									<p>This device will be compact with a rechargeable power supply for easy portability and use plugged in and unplugged. Its ability to be adjusted will come from 2 dials: 1 for the Y-elevation and the other for the power. This interactive system is designed to be as easy and idiot proof as possible and require minimal effort, experience, and knowledge to use to its full ability. The launching mechanism with be a simple spinning wheel system that, to save power, will only run when the ball is loaded and ready to be fired. One the wheel is up to speed, the ball will be fed into it, launching it out of the chamber and the wheel will wind down until it is returned. Although the wheel will be easily adjustable and create its own unpredictability for the ball launch, so the dog cannot just sit and catch it, it also requires more power and can result in motor ware over time. The system will also have a self-training mode where, with a flick of a switch, it will drop a treat into a bowl for the dog to enjoy whenever the ball is put into the feeder. The feeder will be as low to the ground as possible to account for all types of dogs and will have an ultrasound sensor inside it to detect whether the ball is rolled in or not. I have chosen this sensor over others so that the dog does not find a way to trick the system into just outputting treats and requires something, the ball, to be fed in. Once the ball is recognised to have been put in the feeder, a conveyer will turn on, moving the ball from the feeder and feeding it into the wheel once it has gotten up to speed. Having the conveyer only move when the ball is put in for the moment of moving it from feeder to launching chamber will save power and allow use of a stepper motor for precise movements. This automated system will have enough battery life to last at least 30 mins when fully charged, and hopefully, if the extra battery weight is not too much, could be looked to be extended to 45 minutes or even over an hour. This will require testing for the power usage of the entire system, how many battery cells will be needed to last that long and how much it will all weight. The outer casing will be cheap, lightweight but durable plastic to protect the mechanics and electronics it is housing from external damage, like weather or user. To recharge, all that is required is to plug a cable into a standard household power outlet and whilst plugged in, will be able to last continuously. The treats system will use a simple rotating disk with a hole and stepper motor to dispense a small amount of dry dog food as a treat for returning the ball.</p>

										<h2>The electric components required are:</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>An ultrasound sensor to detect the ball.</li>
											<li>3 stepper motors for the dispenser, conveyer, and gear system to adjust launch pitch.</li>
											<li>A DC motor for the wheel; 2 potentiometers to adjust launch pitch and amplitude.</li>
											<li>A switch to turn self-training mode on and off.</li>
											<li>A rechargeable power supply with a cable and plug to attach to standard power outlet.</li>
											<li>CPU to program and run the system, like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.</li>
										</ul>

										<h2>The hardware required is:</h2>
										<ul>
											<liPlastic casing to house the system.</li>
											<li>Plastic funnel and tubing for the ball to roll down and launch out of.</li>
											<li>Lightweight wheel with rubber to grip the ball to launch it.</li>
											<li>A container to hold dry dog food.</li>
											<li>A bowl to dispense the dry dog food into.</li>
											<li>A plastic disk to grab a small amount of dog food and dispense it as it rotates.</li>
											<li>A worm gear system to adjust the launch pitch.</li>

									<p>The software required depends on the CPU used in the system as different CPUs require different software to be able to communicate with and insert code into to program them.</p>
									<p>This project will only require basic systems engineering experience and knowledge. Arduino is a simple CPU to program and run and no overly complicated components or systems are being implemented. The most difficult part that requires the most skill will be cutting the plastic tubes, funnel and disk and assembling everything in the correct place, soldering all the wires and attaching components and debugging and synchronising the code with the rest of the system. Realistically, this project is something basic that can be done in year 8 systems engineering and I believe I have all the required skills and knowledge to complete this project. All that I am missing is the components, hardware, soldering iron and solder.</p>
									<p>If this project is successful, it would mean an easy-to-use system for overly energetic dogs to amuse themselves and exercise with as their owners relax. And a system like this, if it can be cheaply made, mass produced and turn a large profit, could be the basis of kickstarting a whole new company or extending the profit margins of one already established. However, that is a very optimistic view and would require creation, testing and implementing first.</p>
